The 2nd Preparing for Careers in Teaching Statistics and Data Science Workshop will be held in Fort Collins, Colorado, on July 27, immediately prior to JSM 2019 in Denver, Colorado. The workshop is designed for graduate students and recent PhDs interested in careers in teaching statistics and data science. Priority will be given to graduate students who finished or will be finishing their program between Spring 2019 and Fall 2021.

This is a one-day workshop to prepare current graduate students for a future role as faculty responsible for teaching statistics and data science to undergraduate students across a variety of disciplines. We envision workshop participants become capable of developing innovative and pedagogically-sound learning experiences for their students inside and outside the classroom and using formative and summative assessment to guide their instructional practice. The ultimate objective of this workshop is to increase the proportion of successful instructors who have the skills, capacity, and inclination to take on the challenges of complex data-oriented teaching in twenty-first century. The workshop also aims to promote interaction, networking, and community building among recent and soon to be PhDs in statistics, data science, and relevant fields who are interested in academic and teaching focused careers and to provide them with valuable insights from leaders in the field. Topics include teaching introductory statistics; teaching data science; teaching-focused career opportunities; opportunities for grants; sharing resources and staying connected. There will be opportunities for interaction and hands-on experience with active learning and computing technologies.

The workshop presenters include Allan Rossman (Cal Poly), Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel (University of Edinburgh, Duke, RStudio), Nicholas Horton (Amherst), and Ulrike Genschel (Iowa State).

All participants will receive funding for one night of lodging. A limited number of travel scholarships are available and will be awarded based on demonstrated need. Applications should be submitted by June 21, but we will review applications as they come in and will try to let you know in a few days of your submission.
