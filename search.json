    "title": "Call recap: Remote teaching",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The topic of our April 21, 2020 call was remote teaching. We had a very productive call with participation from four mentors (Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, Beth Chance, Nick Horton, Allan Rossman), and nearly ten mentees – all participants from PTT 2019.\nThe main advice that came out of the conversations surrounding remote teaching focused on connecting with students, both as individuals and as groups.\nBelow we share more detailed notes from the discussion in Q&A format.\nIf courses in the fall are entirely online, how can you build a classroom community with students who have never met each other?\n\nSpend more time at the beginning of the semester/quarter/course building a community, using interactive tasks.\nAt beginning of course you could potentially meet for short periods of time ~15 minutes, where students can interact with one another and you.\nKeep in mind the time differences for non-domestic students! Don’t require to attend in-person at 3am!\n\nWhat are people’s preferences for recorded versus live lectures?\n\nRecorded lectures, like in-person lectures, are not very effective. Try to find ways to interact with the students and have them interact with each other, such as students peer reviewing each other’s work.\nAgain, if you are considering synchronous teaching, be mindful of the time zone differences for students.\nIf you expect students to be reading the textbook, provide them with guidance on how/what to read. This task may not come naturally to many students.\nYou can pre-record some (but not all) materials. This would allow for a remote classroom feeling similar to a “flipped” classroom.\nBreak-out rooms may be a tool to consider for group work, but you may need to “peak in” on the rooms and encourage students to work together and/or stay on task.\nKeep in mind that student’s spaces and/or technology may not be great and may hinder them from being able to contribute to a group discussion the way you may have originally envisioned.\n\nIs it appropriate to force students to turn on their video?\n\nAgain, students may have limitations regarding the spaces they use to watch class and the computers they use to participate.\nThere may be students who watch class from their carport/garage, because it is the quietest place for them to watch.\nIf you turn-on the option that allows for students to rename themselves, then they can add “can’t unmute” to the end of their name. This lets you know why students are not sharing their audio/video.\n\nHow do redirect students to use a discussion board to post their questions, so aren’t overwhelmed with a large volume of student emails?\n\nYou can make a policy at the start of the course that all non grade related questions will only be answered on the discussion board, not through email.\nStudents may not know whether their question is “grade related” and will send you an email. You can respond asking for them to post the question on the discussion board and incentivize them by saying that you will respond immediately.\nYou can motivate a student to post on the discussion board by making it extra work for them. For example, you could require that a student post their question and a summary of your response to the discussion board, if you answer their question through email.\n\nHow do you prevent students from just working alone?\non group projects\n\nYou can randomly assign groups, and hope that students will work together.\nFor group projects you can have group evaluations, so each group member knows they will be evaluated on their participation.\nBlackboard allows for file exchanges! Some instructors have found that groups of three are the magic number. Larger groups tend to leave people behind. You can see who contributed what files to Blackboard, as a proxy to student involvement.\n\non group work\n\nAdding time for groups to talk about a formative assessment (e.g. readiness assessment tests) before they submit it can help boost group member involvement.\nAs an instructor, you can go into breakout rooms to help facilitate group discussions and show student how to share content.\nExplicitly show students how to use the platform you are using, don’t just assume they know how to use it!\n\nWhat are tools instructors have used for students to work together on coding tasks?\n\nGitHub + RStudio Cloud\nTeamviewer + RStudio Server, allows for a team environment that feels Google Doc like.\nlivecode package will allow students to follow along while you code. Students can copy and paste the code you are running, and run it locally instead of just following along.\n\nWhat are some assessment strategies instructors have used? What about high stakes exams?\n\nCan use LockDown Browser (Respondus) to ensure students aren’t Googling exam questions.\nCan take exam on Zoom, to allow students to send you live questions for clarification.\nRespondus Monitor monitors student’s webcams to monitor their eye activity.\nWhen you are writing exam questions, type the question into Google! Then you can see what answers students will see if they search. Try to make your exam questions less Google-able, by adding additional steps they would need to take in order to find an answer.\n\nHave instructors used oral exams for final exams?\n\nSome instructors have done this for in person exams, but not online.\nThese environments are very stressful for students, so disentangling their understanding from their stress and emotions would be very difficult. Thus, this environment would require a great deal of thought on what a __ grade looks like.\nConsider if this style of an exam would bring students even more stress, when already under the stress of a global pandemic."

    "text": "The topic of our November 21, 2020 call was first year as a faculty member. The call was attended by three mentors (Beth Chance, Ulrike Genschel,and Allan Rossman), and four mentees (Allison, Joyce, Abhishek, and Asli).\nQuestion: What to expect during your first year as a faculty member.\nAbhishek Chakraborty (in his first year at Lawrence University)\n\nUnexpected events during the first year of teaching:\n\nlots of time spent prepping teaching material (twice what was expected)\ncreating assignments took nearly an entire day\ndifficulties choosing what to teach\n\nlearning about the dynamics of classes\ntaught 2 new courses, 1 fall and 1 spring\n\nTo support faculty in choosing what to teach and creating assignments, the department provided:\n\nshared materials from other colleagues\ncourse descriptions to follow\n\nflexibility to add/emphasize topics important to him/students\nflexibility to spend additional time where needed (e.g. hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals)\n\n\n\nQuestion: What does data science mean? What are the expectations of teaching positions that request/prefer experience with data science?\n\nSuggestions:\n\nLook at what the department teaches, and the descriptions of the courses\nConsider whether you would envision teaching those courses\nConsider what statistical languages you are comfortable teaching in\n\nAt Lawrence they are proposing a minor in statistics/data science\n\nAs a new faculty Abhishek helped to write the proposal for the minor\nThe minor is interdisciplinary with Computer Science\nThe minor encompasses 6 courses: 200-level Intro to R, 200-level Statistics for Data Science, Machine Learning, Bayesian Methods, Mathematical Statistics, and an Interdisciplinary capstone\nSome of the courses are new for the minor and Abhishek collaborated in creating the courses and choosing the level at which they are taught (e.g Machine Learning is a 200-level course with a prereq of either 1 CS course or 1 Math course)\n\n\nQuestion: Joyce was asked to potentially teach “topic” courses for businesses outside of academia. Do others have experiences teaching these types of courses? What should she consider when deciding whether to teach them and what topics to teach?\n\nSuggestions:\n\nKnow what backgrounds your participants have\nUnderstand what they expect to get out of the course\nCommunicate what is plausible for you to accomplish with the time you are give, since they will likely expect too much\nConsider what your time is worth, especially as you begin/finish your dissertation\n\n\nQuestion: What are people’s experiences reaching out to companies for projects to use for undergraduate research or statistical consulting?\n\nSuggestions:\n\nMake use of the alumni association for connections to graduates of the university who have businesses in the area\nLook into non-profit organizations in the area\nFind a contact for the large companies in the area to begin conversations\n\n\nQuestion: (Ulrike to Abhishek) As a new faculty, what else have you spent your time on?\n(Abhishek)\n\nIf you keep your door open, students will come!\nDepartment meetings\nRevisions to the major\nCreating the statistics/data science minor\nDecided to do no research for the first term and to instead focus on teaching\nWill start advising students during second year\nPrepping old courses is far less time intensive\nDoing independent study with a student during the winter term\nMentor says to “always think about giving yourself a break”\n\n(Ulrike)\n\nExpect to serve on committees\n\nThese are low loads for new faculty\nPossibility of serving on curriculum advisory committee(s)\n\nThere is a long-term benefit to doing things for yourself!\nMake connections with other young faculty at a similar stage in their career\n\n(Alan)\n\nDon’t try to do everything!\nYou don’t need to teach the perfect course the first time!\n\nThe first time, try to do a competent job.\nThe second time, make improvements.\nThe third time the course should be closer to what you’d ideally want.\n\nSet realistic expectations for yourself!\n\nQuestion: What are considerations to make when proposing a department “flip” a course which a large number of non-tenured faculty teach?\n(Alan)\n\nMake sure you have buy-in from senior people in the department\nBe empathetic on instructor’s time–they are likely teaching a large number of courses\nUnderstand how much instructors are teaching and where–it is possible they are teaching at multiple colleges/universities\nSupport instructors by providing materials they can use in their classroom\nConsider the client disciplines the course(s) service, and include faculty from those department(s) in the conversations\n\n(Ulrike)\n\nInvite the instructors to contribute in the changes\n\n(Asli)\n\nTo support changing the Introductory Statistics course, she:\n\nbrought in articles supporting the changes she was proposing\nmade sure the process feel team oriented"
